Result from test Command:

Searching for: space 
Found space in the Linked List 
Found space in the Dynamic Array 
Searching for: xyzzy 
Could not find word in Linked List. 
Could not find word in DynamicArray. 

Comment:

The implementation of `TestSearch` successfully navigated both dynamic arrays 
and linked lists to locate the term "space," indicating precise functionality in 
data management and search algorithms. In contrast, the term "xyzzy" was correctly identified as absent from both structures, showcasing the program's accuracy.

Comment:

Valgrind's memory check revealed no leaks, affirming the program's efficient memory usage and the robustness of the implementation, highlighting a well-structured approach to memory management and search efficiency in data structures.
